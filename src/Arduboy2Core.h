 * This class is inherited by Arduboy2Base and thus also Arduboy2, so wouldn't
 * normally be used directly by a sketch.
 *
 * \note
 * A friend class named _Arduboy2Ex_ is declared by this class. The intention
 * is to allow a sketch to create an _Arduboy2Ex_ class which would have access
 * to the private and protected members of the Arduboy2Core class. It is hoped
 * that this may eliminate the need to create an entire local copy of the
 * library, in order to extend the functionality, in most circumstances.
